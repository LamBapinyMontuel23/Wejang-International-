= Getting support for BTM

Free support is provided on a best-effort basis. Commercial support (development and production) can be acquired directly from Bitronix Software.

== Mailing list

TODO - how does this work these days?

(Old: You should send any question, remark or support request to the BTM users mailing list.
Send an email to user-subscribe @ btm.codehaus.org to register then send your questions to user @ btm.codehaus.org)

Alternatively you can use link:http://bitronix-transaction-manager.10986.n7.nabble.com/[Nabble] as a more convenient access to the mailing list.
