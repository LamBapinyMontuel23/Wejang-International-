= JMS servers XA support evaluation

Those are the information collected while testing BTM against some JMS servers. Also included:

* An overall evaluation of the database's XA support
* Special features and/or limitations

.XA only
****
JMS servers not providing an implementation of `javax.jms.XAConnectionFactory` have not been included.
****

If you find mistakes, inconsistencies or simply want some other database to be tested (as long as there is at least a free trial version available) just let us know via an issue in Github and we'll consider your request.

[[activemq]]
== ActiveMQ

=== Supported version(s)
Tested against versions 4.2 and 5.1. All 4.x version prior to 4.1.1 are broken regarding recovery and cannot be used.

=== Settings

Local transactions cannot be mixed well with global transactions thus you should not enable `allowLocalTransactions` or ActiveMQ will throw an exception.

=== Heuristics

I could not find how to list in-doubt transactions nor how to manually terminate them.

=== Example ResourceLoader configuration

    resource.ds.className=org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQXAConnectionFactory
    resource.ds.uniqueName=amq
    resource.ds.maxPoolSize=5
    resource.ds.driverProperties.brokerURL=tcp://localhost:61616

[[swiftmq]]
== SwiftMQ

=== Supported version(s)
Tested against versions 6.2 but works fine with more recent versions too. You need the JMS XA/ASF Swiftlet extension to be able to use XA transactions.

=== Settings

All default settings are fine.

=== Heuristics

The console can be used to list in-doubt transactions and to heuristically terminate and forget them.

=== Example ResourceLoader configuration

    resource.ds.className=bitronix.tm.resource.jms.JndiXAConnectionFactory
    resource.ds.uniqueName=smq
    resource.ds.maxPoolSize=5
    resource.ds.driverProperties.initialContextFactory=com.swiftmq.jndi.InitialContextFactoryImpl
    resource.ds.driverProperties.providerUrl=smqp://localhost:4001/timeout=10000
    resource.ds.driverProperties.name=QueueConnectionFactory

[[hornetq]]
== HornetQ

=== Supported version(s)

Tested against versions 2.0.0.BETA5. The `JndiXAConnectionFactory` included in BTM 1.3.2 and lower is too limited, you need BTM 1.3.3 or higher to use HornetQ.

=== Settings

All default settings are fine.

=== Heuristics

A JMX console (like the JDK jconsole tool) can be used to list in-doubt transactions and to heuristically terminate them. Just have a look at the org.hornetq/Server/Core JMX object which contains 3 interesting operations: listPreparedTransactions, commitPreparedTransaction, rollbackPreparedTransaction.

Still under investigation.

=== Example ResourceLoader configuration

    resource.ds.className=bitronix.tm.resource.jms.JndiXAConnectionFactory
    resource.ds.uniqueName=hornet
    resource.ds.maxPoolSize=5
    resource.ds.driverProperties.initialContextFactory=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory
    resource.ds.driverProperties.providerUrl=jnp://localhost:1099
    resource.ds.driverProperties.extraJndiProperties.java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces
    resource.ds.driverProperties.name=XAConnectionFactory

[[sonicmq]]
== SonicMQ (Progress Software)

=== Supported version(s)
Tested against versions 7.6. The `JndiXAConnectionFactory` included in BTM 1.3.2 and lower is too limited (extraJndiProperties), you need BTM 1.3.3 or higher to use SonicMQ. Seems to support local transactions.

=== Settings

All default settings are fine.

=== Heuristics

Still under investigation.

=== Example ResourceLoader configuration

    resource.cf.className=bitronix.tm.resource.jms.JndiXAConnectionFactory
    resource.cf.uniqueName=sonicmq
    resource.cf.maxPoolSize=5
    resource.cf.driverProperties.initialContextFactory=com.sonicsw.jndi.mfcontext.MFContextFactory
    resource.cf.driverProperties.providerUrl=tcp://localhost:2506
    resource.cf.driverProperties.securityPrincipal=username
    resource.cf.driverProperties.securityCredentials=password
    resource.cf.driverProperties.name=xaConnectionFactory
    resource.cf.driverProperties.extraJndiProperties.com.sonicsw.jndi.mfcontext.domain=domain

=== Required Jars

mfcontext-7.6.jar, sonic_Client-7.6.jar (warning JMS API is included in the Jar), sonic_Crypto-7.6.jar, sonic_XA-7.6.jar, sonic_XMessage-7.6.jar

These documents are very useful. Could some one take up the task of updating it rather than a one-time static document? For example, RabbitMQ might be considered also

=== lorban Ludovic Orban

RabbitMQ does not support XA AFAIK. If you'd like to evaluate a few other servers, feel free to do so and post your findings to the mailing list.
