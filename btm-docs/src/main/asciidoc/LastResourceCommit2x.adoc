= Last Resource Commit optimization for JDBC

.Be Careful
****
There is one caveat with Last Resource Commit. There is a small chance that a transaction ends up with inconsistent results across participating resources if BTM crashes while a transaction is in-flight. The chance is small but it exists so be careful when using that feature. This is in no way a limitation of BTM but of the concept itself.
****

Please note that if you only intend to run transactions against a single database using Last Resource Commit this scenario is 100% safe, otherwise not.

In theory, only databases supporting XA and providing a `javax.sql.XADataSource` implementation can be used with transaction managers. In practice, there is a way around this limitation.

The Last Resource Commit optimization (sometimes referred to as Last Resource Gambit or Last Agent optimization) allows a single non-XA database to participate in a XA transaction by cleverly ordering the resources.

.Maximum one non-XA resource
****
There can be at most one datasource emulating XA with Last Resource Commit participating in a transaction. If it happens that you're trying to use a second emulating datasource while one has already been used, BTM will throw an exception. Again, this is not a limitation of BTM but of the concept itself.
****

To enable it, you just have to create a `PoolingDataSource` using the https://github.com/bitronix/btm/blob/master/btm/src/main/java/bitronix/tm/resource/jdbc/lrc/LrcXADataSource.java[`bitronix.tm.resource.jdbc.lrc.LrcXADataSource`] as the `XADataSource` implementation.

Here's an example of code configuring a HSQLDB datasource:

    PoolingDataSource myDataSource = new PoolingDataSource();
    myDataSource.setClassName("bitronix.tm.resource.jdbc.lrc.LrcXADataSource");
    myDataSource.setUniqueName("hsqldb");
    myDataSource.setMaxPoolSize(5);
    myDataSource.setAllowLocalTransactions(true);
    myDataSource.getDriverProperties().setProperty("driverClassName", "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
    myDataSource.getDriverProperties().setProperty("url", "jdbc:hsqldb:/the/db/path");
    myDataSource.getDriverProperties().setProperty("user", "sa");
    myDataSource.getDriverProperties().setProperty("password", "theSaPassword");

and the same example viewed as a Resource Loader configuration

    resource.ds.className=bitronix.tm.resource.jdbc.lrc.LrcXADataSource
    resource.ds.uniqueName=hsqldb
    resource.ds.maxPoolSize=5
    resource.ds.allowLocalTransactions=true
    resource.ds.driverProperties.driverClassName=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    resource.ds.driverProperties.url=jdbc:hsqldb:/the/db/path
    resource.ds.driverProperties.user=sa
    resource.ds.driverProperties.password=theSaPassword
